I. Login to Linode Cloud Manager at:

Your Linode has a unique IP address that identifies it to 
other devices and users on the internet.
  1. Click the Linodes menu item in the Cloud Manager’s left hand navigation.

  2. Find your Linode, click on it’s name and navigate to Networking.
     click Rockhounding
     Debian 8, Nanode 1GB: 1 CPU, 25GB Storage, 1GB RAM

     click Networking tab

  3. Your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses appear under the IPv4 and IPv6 sections.
  IP Addresses:
  
  IPv4:            173.255.210.242
  default gateway: 173.255.210.1

  IPv6: 2600:3c01::f03c:91ff:febc:652b

  4. Log in Using SSH

  you can log in via SSH. The following instructions
